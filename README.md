# TotalCom 1

## Summary
⚠️ Archived Project for Portfilio Purposes ⚠️

TC1 or TotalCom-1 is my first client and my first customer facing website ever! It was in 2015 and this website is still in use and receives very, very few changes.

## Purpose
Create a website for TotalCom-1 to branch out to new enterprise facing customers across the world and provide a clear and concise summary of their services, why they're so good at what they provide and how to contact them.

## Technologies

### CSS
Just standard CSS, no design library or design framework besides the classic `reset.css`. Even custom animations instead of using `animate.css`.

### HTML5
No compilers or frameworks for HTML either, just plain, standard HTML5. Even before the introduction of specific element types that we use today.

## What I learned
- The importance of media queries and not using different style sheets for different device sizes
- Heading elements should be in order
- Icon librarys can/will be depreciated, don't hard link to 3rd party cdn's
